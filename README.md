# finalAssignment
This is the final assignment for CF Foundations I

Cardsuits.html shows a deck of cards (yup, all the way down the page) and allows the user to select a particular suit 
and have those cards shuffled.  The user can choose between all the card suits and even reset everything and start over.

There is a suits.css and cards.js file that accompany the .html file.

Resources and collaborators include: 
- TA Larry: who added the .card jquery (and if/else ifs), also tweaked my .click(functions)
- Co-worker Raini: who helped me figure out how to enable clicking other suit buttons without resetting and how to
  "clear" everything and begin again
- MDN and lots of Google searches
